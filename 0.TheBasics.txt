JEST is a unit testing framework focusing on simplicity.
It works with projects using: Babel, TypeScript, Node, React, Angular, Vue and more!

INSTALLATION

If you want to test code written in vanillaJS, there are no more dependencies, you are good to go.
However, you need to install several other dependencies, in case of react, node or other flavours of JS.

If you are using react with vite as bundler, install all these dependencies:
npm install --save-dev jest @types/jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom jest-environment-jsdom
